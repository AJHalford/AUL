<font style="color:'rgb(181,198,137)'">[The Community-Wide Tracking of Efficiency and Effectiveness ISWAT ](https://www.iswat-cospar.org/O1-01)</font> working group (formally known as the [Assessment of Understanding and Quantifyning Progress working group](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/assessment/topics/trackprogress.php)) has put together a set of resources to learn about the Application Usability Level Framework, find papers using the AULs, and other useful resources. You can find our peer reviewed published paper on the definition of the AULs along with examples of projects using them here in the [Journal of Space Weather and Space Climate](https://www.swsc-journal.org/articles/swsc/abs/2019/01/swsc190028/swsc190028.html)

The Application Usability levels (AULs) are a tracking framework developed to help ensure that the end product of your project is useable by the people you expect to use it. Seems quite simple - really it's just putting together best practices to ensure the usability of what you are developing. 

The AULs have nine levels and three phases.

There are multiple frameworks used within the broader communities and each has their specific motivations and thus benifits and issues. It is useful to determine which matches the motivation and intent of a project at the start and apply it throughout the duration of your project.
